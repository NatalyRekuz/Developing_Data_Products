## About TRIZ

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ):

TRIZ (Russian: teoriya resheniya izobretatelskikh zadach, literally: "theory of the resolution of invention-related tasks") is "a problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature". It was developed by the Soviet inventor and science-fiction author Genrich Altshuller (1926-1998) and his colleagues, beginning in 1946. In English the name is typically rendered as "the theory of inventive problem solving", and occasionally goes by the English acronym TIPS.

Basic information about TRIZ is summarized [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ).

As a result of the development of TRIZ is gradually moved beyond solving inventive problems in the technical field. Today it is also used in non-technical fields (business, art, literature, education, politics, and others.).


## About App

The goal of app is to explore how the changing the scope of application of TRIZ is reflected in the content of the articles of site ["The TRIZ Journal"](https://triz-journal.com/).

This app was created as requested by the TRIZ coach [Andrew Kuryan](http://triz.by/), [EPAM](https://www.epam.com/), Minsk.

The time periods for the study were chosen by the customer. Articles for the study were downloaded from the site ["The TRIZ Journal"](https://triz-journal.com/) and grouped into 3 sets accordingly to chosen time period.
The articles from every set were merged into 3 text files respectively for further processing. 


All files used for this app can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/NatalyRekuz/Developing_Data_Products)
